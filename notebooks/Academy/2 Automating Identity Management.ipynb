    "In this demo, we will explore how to automate identity management using the Databricks SDK for Python. We will learn how to manage users, service principals, and groups programmaticaly within a Databricks workspace. Through the Account Client component of the Databricks SDK library, we will demonstrate key tasks such as creating and querying users, service principals, and groups, as well as managing group membership. Additionally, we will cover how to assign administrative roles and delete resources, ensuring efficient resource management within your Databricks environment."

    "Databricks provides comprehensive funcionality through its Python SDK, enabling seamless interaction with various Databricks resources. In this demo, we will focus on using the Account Client library of the Databricks SDK for Python to programmaticaly manage users, service principals, and groups within a Databricks account.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to leverage the Databricks SDK with the Account Client:\n",
    "- Utilize the SDK to directly invoke methods for managing users, groups, and service principals without needing to manually construct HTTP requests.\n",
    "- Automate resource management by integrating the Account Client library into Python scripts, streamlining operations such as onboarding users or configuring service principals.\n",
    "- Incorporate the SDK into larger automation frameworks, leveraging its intuitive API design to manage Databricks resources efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of which approach you take to utilize the Account Client library of the Databricks SDK, you need the following from the account console:\n",
    "- The account ID of a user with account admin privileges.\n",
    "- The client ID and client secret token generated for a service principal with account privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the operation, you may need to provide additional parameters of payloads to fulfill the request, such as user details or group configurations."
